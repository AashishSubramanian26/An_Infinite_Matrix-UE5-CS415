# An_Infinite_Matrix_CS415
 
This is my first game assignment for my CS415, Game Development course. This game is an endless runner where you must avoid obstacles and go through the gates to increase your score. It will continue until your health reaches 0 and you start at 3. This assignment was done completely in Blueprints and gave me a better understanding of how they work. 

In this assignment, the goal was to follow a tutorial provided here: https://www.kodeco.com/454-how-to-create-a-simple-game-in-unreal-engine-4, but afterward was required to add certain features to the game. I needed to add the following: A health system, a score, health packs, player projectile attacks, enemies, an increase in the player speed over time, and a creative modification to the game which was shaking the screen after taking damage as well as implement sound effects after grabbing the med kit and taking damage.
